How to create modular application in javascript?

com.ibm.app.Hello.java 
 com/ibm/app/Hello.java
 com/ibm/app/Hello.class

javascript has no such fine grained modularity.

js is file based

hello.js, customer.js

js did not address how code can be shared across files.

 Javascript is file based modularity physically
 but logically there is no such modularity at language level.

 collection of variable declarations and function.

Once js started growing in large scale, dev struck to organize code.

2000, Smart developers started thinking about how to modualrize js code.
 

Module design patterns came.

1.Namespace design pattern : 2000 : jquery
2.AMD -Async Module Defintion : dojo
---------------------------------------------------------
3.CJS - Common JS =  namespace + amd
4.ES 6 Module design pattern  = amd + cjs
------------------------------------------------------------
5.System = AMD = CJS + ES 6
6.UMD = NAMESPACE + AMD + CJS = ES 6


only two design patterns are used in development

1.CJS - Common JS =  namespace + amd
2.ES 6 Module design pattern  = amd + cjs

CJS ; implemented inside node js. node supports commonjs by default.

I can organize the code , based on these patterns, but what about runtimes?
  js runtime never suppport these patterns directly then each design pattern is lib.

 Loaders : it is simple js lib to help link and load js files.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


lets start cjs first;
......................

cjs is built in node js.
node supports cjs in built. no separate loader or linker is required
but if you run cjs code on browsers , we need loaders.


Common js:

1.How to share code
  exports
  module.exports

2.How to link files
  require()


lab:

use case how to link files;

common js provides an api called "require(fileName)"
 -it is in built function provided by node
 -require function takes file name as parameter without .js extension.
 -require function  return value.


eg:
  function require(fileName){
    ......
   return somevalue;
 }

How to share code?

code could be

-variable declaration having any literals(strings,numbers,booleans,objects,functions...)
-function declaration
-class declaration


code can be shared in cjs via two containers.

exports
module.exports.

what is exports?

"exports" is just a variable.
"exports" variable is implemented inside require() function

function require(fileName){
   let exports={};
    ......
   return exports;
 }
exports value by default is empty literal object.
let res=require('./fileName');
res ==== {}
'


function require(fileName){
   let exports={};
   exports.greet = 'Hello'
    ......
   return exports;
 }

index.js
//. - current dir, mylib is js file to be linked
// let res = require('./mylib')

// console.log(res)
// console.log(res.greet)
// console.log(res.name)
// console.log(res.isActive)
const { greet, name, isActive, skills, score, sayHai, address } = require('./mylib')
const { log } = console;
log(greet)
log(name)
log(isActive)
log(skills)
log(score);
log(sayHai())
log(address.city)


src/mylib.js

//object augmentation on exports variable
exports.greet = 'Hello'
exports.name = 'Subramanian'
exports.isActive = true;
exports.score = 10;
exports.sayHai = function () {
    return 'Hai';
}
exports.address = {
    city: 'coimbatore'
}
exports.skills = ['java', 'javascript', 'node', 'microservices']

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
module.exports

-similar to exports
-dont pack code inside literal object
-it returns code as it is
 if code is function, it returns function.
 if code is variable , it returns variable


function require(fileName){
   let message='hello'

   //if exports ----use literal object
   else
   module.exports =message;

   return module.exports   
}

-exports can return mulitple items at the same time
-module.exports can return only one thing at the time.


module.exports is usefull

 -to return classes
 -to return functions
 -to return arrays
 -to return objects

any thing but only one.


const OrderService = require('./OrderService');

console.log(OrderService)
let { findAll } = new OrderService();
console.log(findAll())

class OrderService {
    constructor() {
        console.log('Order service is being intialized')
    }
    findAll() {
        return 'findAll'
    }
    save(order) {
        console.log(order);
        return 'save'
    }
}
module.exports = OrderService;

Blocking IO And Non blocking IO:   Sync and Async Programming
..............................................................



Blocking IO:

Input/output (IO) refers to interaction with devices such as a hard drive, network or database. 

Generally anything that is not happening in the CPU is called IO.

When you call an API that requests data from IO, you will not get a response instantly, but with some delay. This delay can be very small for requesting a file on a hard drive, and much longer when requesting data from a network. 

This is because the data you request from IO devices has to travel longer to the caller. For instance:
A file stored on a hard drive must be transferred through SATA cables and main board buses to the CPU

The data from a network resource located on a server far away must travel through network cables, routers and eventually the network interface card (NIC) in your computer to the CPU.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Calling an API that requests data from IO will cause the running thread to “block”, i.e. 

it is waiting until the requested data has returned to the caller.

When a thread is blocked in Linux, it will be put in a Sleep state by the kernel until data has returned to the caller

Threads in sleep state immediately give up its access to the CPU, so to not waste CPU time.


After IO is ready, the thread is taken out of the Sleep state and put in Runnable state.

Threads in this state are eligible to be executed on the CPU again.

The thread scheduler will put the thread on a CPU when one is available. 

The process of taking threads on and off the CPU is called context switching.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Why non-blocking IO?

The main benefit of non-blocking IO is that we need "less threads" to handle the same amount of IO requests.

When multiple calls to IO are done using blocking IO, for each call a new thread is created. 

A thread costs around 1MB, and there are some costs due to context switching. 

If you have a web server that handles 50k connections per second,

a thread per connection can be quite expensive.


Types of blocking
  There are actually two types of thread blocking:

1.CPU-bound blocking
2.IO-bound blocking

CPU-bound blocking
In this case the thread gets blocked because of some CPU intensive task it performs takes more time than “instantly”. 

For example when generating a bunch of prime numbers or rendering a 3d model. With CPU-bound blocking the thread is blocked because it’s actively being executed on the processor.


IO-bound blocking

Here, the thread gets blocked because it has to wait for data to return from an IO source, such as a network or a hard drive. 

The kernel will notice that there is no data available from IO and will therefore put the thread in some “sleep” state. Hence, with IO-bound blocking the thread is not¹ actively being executed on the processor.


Non-blocking IO

APIs that use blocking IO will block the thread until data from IO has returned.

 So what happens when you call a non-blocking API? Very well, it returns instantly and will not block the thread. 

This means the thread can immediately continue executing the code that comes after calling the API.

When data has returned from IO, the caller will be notified that the data is ready. 

This is generally done with a callback function that has access to the returned data.


Network IO and sockets:

To understand how non-blocking IO works under the hood we first need some understanding of how IO works at low level. 

A common use case for non-blocking IO is network IO, so it is best explained in this context. 


At kernel level a socket is used as an abstraction to communicate with a NIC.

Socket is entry and exit point of data transmission from hardware to os



At kernel level a socket is used as an abstraction to communicate with a NIC.

Socket is entry and exit point of data transmission from hardware to os


 This socket takes care of reading and writing data to/from the NIC, which in turn sends the data over the UTP cable on its way to the internet. 

For example, if you go to a URL in your browser; at low level the data in your HTTP request is written to a socket using the send(2) system call. 

When a response is returned, the response data can be read from that socket using the recv(2) 
 system call.
 The important thing to understand here is that when data has returned from network IO, it is ready to be read from the socket.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Blocking are implemented at os level using os socket apis.
 eg : send and recv ------->are blocking apis

if any language uses these api as sys call under hood , those api are blocking apis

if you take java

 readFile()---------send()------>socket-------|

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Non blocking apis are provided by os only.Where pl just call those apis
........................................................................

flow:

Request1- application----select--------|kernal adds fd0 to watchlist -----devices
  <------------------------------------------------------------

Request2- application----select--------|kernal adds fd1 to watchlist ---device

Request3- application----select--------|kernal adds fd2 to watchlist --------device




Most non-blocking frameworks use an infinite loop that constantly checks (polls) if data is returned from IO.

This is often called the event loop. 

An event loop is literally a while(true) loop that in each iteration will check if data is ready to read from a network socket. 

Technically, sockets are implemented as file descriptors (FD) on UNIX systems.

It is therefore better to say that a FD is checked for ready data. 

The list of FDs that you want to check for ready data is generally called the interest list.


Operatings systems provide event loop construct for making non blocking io:


Let’s zoom a bit in on the event loop:
......................................

 Each (major) operating system provides kernel level APIs to help create an event loop.

In Linux there is epoll or io_uring,
BSD uses kqueue 
Windows has IOCP.
Each of these APIs is able to check FDs for ready data with a computational complexity of around.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What is Node.js?

Node.js is a platform to build non blocking io(async io) applications using javascript.

Node.js was created to build javascript server side io / network io applications.

History node.js:

node.js was inspired from nginx webserver(which is nonblocking httpserver).

node.js built on google v8 javascript engine.

Ryan Dhal who created node.js who decided to provide network io/fs io apis on js language.

Ryan Dhal who provided extra api for io operations inside js language , since js already supports non blocking features.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How node.js bridges non blocking io with os?

with help of libuv.


libuv:

It is platform abstraction lib

libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.

Components of node.js
......................

1.v8 - to run javascript 
2.libuv - multi platform io event loop abstraction lib.


Points:

1.application code is written using js 
2.js high level apis is mapped with javascript apis
3.js code is mapped with libuv and other libs with help of "C++"
4.other apis like openssl are provided as a lib which bound with high level javascript api.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How nodjs implements async io notification and how it respond , how data we get it?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Non blocking implementation:

non blocking apis are event driven,handler based,bound with low level apis.

non blocking apis are provided by node and libvu,os

console.log is not non blocking api.

how to know?

refer node.js doc

classification of non blocking api

1.timers
2.io apis
   file system
   network io
     -tcp,http.......

javascript provides way(styles) of writing nonblocking
.......................................................

1.callback style - this is core
2.promise style - abstraction of callbacks
3.async ....await style


callback /handlers : 
-function, 
-can take args,return values
-function is passed as parameter to non blocking apis : Registration.
  function is registered for notification for events with high level async apis.

1.timers :

settimeout
setinterval

//non blocking apis

//blocking api
const hi = () => console.log('hai')

const sayHello = handler => {
    //non blocking api ;timer 
    //register a with timer event within event queue
    setTimeout(handler, 5000);
};
hi();
sayHello(() => {
    console.log('hey , how are you?')
});
sayHello(() => {
    console.log('hey , how are you?')
});
hi();

1.Whether this is able to understand quickly
2.Whether this code is able to debug
3.Whehter this code is scalable?
4.whether this code is maintaiable?




  "No" : This is what we call as "Callback hell".

The way we write the code is called callback hell

fs.readdir(source, function (err, files) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error finding files: ' + err)
  } else {
    files.forEach(function (filename, fileIndex) {
      console.log(filename)
      gm(source + filename).size(function (err, values) {
        if (err) {
          console.log('Error identifying file size: ' + err)
        } else {
          console.log(filename + ' : ' + values)
          aspect = (values.width / values.height)
          widths.forEach(function (width, widthIndex) {
            height = Math.round(width / aspect)
            console.log('resizing ' + filename + 'to ' + height + 'x' + height)
            this.resize(width, height).write(dest + 'w' + width + '_' + filename, function(err) {
              if (err) console.log('Error writing file: ' + err)
            })
          }.bind(this))
        }
      })
    })
  }
})


callback hell is other wise called as doom of pyrbid.

How to write better callback programming /async/non blocking ? or How to avoid callback hell?



In 2005, JQUERY team started with working complex callback patterns, they found callback
hell problem.

They proposed a  Design pattern to write better callback programming(Async) programming.

  "Promise".

Promise is design pattern which hides complexity of callback patterns


SInce Promise is design pattern, many people have implemented Promise design pattern.

1.JQuery -first promise implementation
2.many libs and frameworks

2012 E6 Committee introduced promise design pattern  as  "Promise" Object  in javascript.


&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Promises and non blocking,async and callback hell issues:
.........................................................

features of Promise Object:

1.Promise by deafult is Async. Which implements timer api with 0 ms .

Promise can be used with any async callback based implementations.



Promise Implemenation:

1. Create Promise Object from Promise contructor
2. Create Promise object from factory apis 

Promise object methods:
1.then - success
2.catch - errors
3.finally - clean up
4.resolve
5.reject
6.all
7.race




Lets code using Promise

Promise Object creations:

1.factory apis.
 resolve
 reject
 both

callback hell and promises:
..............................
//Promise Object creation, handle succcess and resolve.

const { log } = console;
//callback version
const sayHello = (callback) => setTimeout(callback, 1000, 'Hello!!!');
sayHello(response => log(response))
//promise version 
//promise does not take any callback as parameter
//results are captured by then and catch methods of Promise Object

const sayHai = () => {
    //send only success
    return Promise.resolve('Hello Promise');
};
const getError = () => {
    return Promise.reject('something went wrong')
}

///some biz logic
const validate = (userName = 'admin', password = 'admin') => {
    if (userName === 'admin' && password === 'admin') {
        return Promise.resolve('Login success')
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('Login failed')
    }
}


console.log('start')
// let mypromise = sayHai();
// mypromise.then(response=>log(response))
//builder pattern /fluent pattern; 

sayHai()
    .then(response => log(response)) //succces/resolve

getError()
    .then(response => log(response))
    .catch(error => log(error));

validate()
    .then(response => log(response))
    .catch(error => log(error));


validate('foo','foo')
    .then(response => log(response))
    .catch(error => log(error));

console.log('end')

async and await ; es 7 keywords


Promise Hell: Promise has limitions;
......................

1.Promise is still  complex when you start scalling complex async operations.

2.Which is not readable ,which uses lot of then, catch blocks

In order to write even simple complex async work flows ES 7 introduced
a concept called "async await" keywords


 It is simplest pattern of Promises.
 It is promise driven only.

         "Sync style of Async Code" 

async key must be used with function declaration.
await is used to pause async calls


getUser()
    .then(login)
    .then(log)
    .catch(log)
    .finally(() => console.log('login done'))


//async .... await keywords
//async key must be part of function declaration; async functions
//await key must be used for promise invocation;

const validate = (userName = 'admin', password = 'admin') => {
    if (userName === 'admin' && password === 'admin') {
        return Promise.resolve('Login success');

Node and Modularity:
....................

node is highly modular platform, you can write modular applications
node by default supports cjs module system.

in node module is called "node module'


Types of modules:

1.Custom module
  Written you , eg: OrderController....
  exports,module.exports
2.in built modules
   Modules are supplied by node , which are supplied during node installation.
3.Third party modules
   provided by third parties, like frameworks,libs etc...




1.node in built modules

1.os module
2.events module
3.file system module
4.path
5.http module

os

//node built in modules; os module
const {cpus,arch} = require('os');

console.log('Total CPUs')
console.log(cpus());
console.log('Arch ',arch())

./ vs ''
.........

 require('./services/TODOService');
  ->here you can see ./
  ./ -current dir
 require('os'); => 
  -here no ./ 

Why?

Note : if you are java devp, you know the classpath , how it works?



require('os');

Node internally uses a search algorthim,node always looks the folder called
 "node_modules" in the current project, if not , then it searches, the node in built 
installtion folder---c:/pf/node/node_nodules--if it finds it will pick up from there else it will throw error.

require('./services/TODOService');
   it will lookup in the current dir or sub dirs only.


error if there is no module;

Event Emitter module;

how to build application event driven programming.

Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous event-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called.


we register and listen for that.

We can build application events; we can make event driven apps.


const EventEmitter = require('events'); //return function;


//domain class
class OrderService extends EventEmitter {
    constructor() {
        super();
        //event registration
        this.on('order.created', data => {
            //process events async
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log('order.created is being processed')
                console.log(data)
            }, 1000)
        });
    }
    //biz api
    placeOrder(order) {
        //async event driven arch
        setTimeout(() => {
            this.emit('order.created', order)
        }, 1000)
    }

}

function start() {

    const orderService = new OrderService();
    orderService.placeOrder({
        id: 1,
        qty: 100,
        price: 1000
    })

}
start();

non blocking io:

Node non blocking io apis

1.fs io
   -files system 
2.network io
  -http : web apps
  -tcp
  -udp



Does node support blocking IO?

Blocking io means

  readFile----stackframe --read file

All blocking io operations are handled by libuv   worker pool threads.
 when you read, node will assign a thread  to read / write file.

Note:
1.Dont use blocking io apis for big files
2.Dont use blocking io apis in network applications.
3.Node supports only disk file io in blocking mode, not network apis


Blocking io dont have callbacks.

                                           Streaming
                                         ..............

Flow of data from one place to another place.

Types of IO Read and write

1.Non Streaming 

 The file which is loaded fully into node buffer and will be delivered to caller.

 This apporach is not good when we read and write concurrently.Node process may crash if no more memory
  
non streamings apis
 fs.readFile and fs.writeFile.

2.Streaming :

->data will be delivered chunk by chunk-(part by part)
->streaming enables continuous flow of data, so node buffer will not full.
->it is suitable for network delivery 
->In node most of network apis are by default streaming only.

Note :

 Streaming enable event driven io.
 Streaming apis are having lot of built in events.



Types of Streams:

1.Readable Stream : input
2.Writeable stream : output
3.Duplex stream : read + output


Built in readable Streams:

HTTP responses, on the client
HTTP requests, on the server
fs read streams
zlib streams
crypto streams
TCP sockets
child process stdout and stderr
process.stdin

Writable Streams:

HTTP requests, on the client
HTTP responses, on the server
fs write streams
zlib streams
crypto streams
TCP sockets
child process stdin
process.stdout, process.stderr

All streaming apis are powered with events
node io streams has built in events.
events are emitted by node.
Our programs are listeners

common events in all io

data event:
 which is emitted by node, for each chunk.

close event:
The 'close' event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying resources (a file descriptor, for example) have been closed.

end event:
The 'end' event is emitted when there is no more data to be consumed from the stream.

Event: 'error'
 The 'error' event may be emitted by a Readable implementation at any time
Typically, this may occur if the underlying stream is unable to generate data due to an underlying internal failure, or when a stream implementation attempts to push an invalid chunk of data.


//file system stream;
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path');
const { log } = console;


const fileName = path.join(__dirname, 'assets/info.txt');
const config = {

//register events
//data event
let data = '';
inputStream.on('data', chunk => {
    log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`)
    //log(chunk);
    data += chunk;
});
inputStream.on('end', () => {
    log('There will be no more data to read!');
    log(data)
});
//error event: for error handling
inputStream.on('error', function (err) {
    log(`Some thing went wrong! ${err}`)
});

                                            Back Pressure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is back pressure?

 Back Pressure is type of problem which occurs when we read and write data togther in stream mode.
 Back Pressure means inputstream is fast, outputstream slow, then data will be lost.

How to handle  Back pressure?

Handling back pressure:
.......................
Pause Input stream if the Node Process memory is full(Buffer),resume if buffer/process memory is empty.

stream.pause() if stream is full
else
stream.resume() if stream is drain


const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const inputfileName = path.join(__dirname, 'assets/big.file');
const outputfileName = path.join(__dirname, 'assets/big_copy.file');

const config = {
    encoding: 'UTF-8'
}

//Back pressure handling
const readerStream = fs.createReadStream(inputfileName, config);
const writeStr = fs.createWriteStream(outputfileName, config);


readerStream.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
    /**
     * Returns: <boolean> false if the stream wishes for the calling code to
     *  wait for the 'drain' event to be emitted before continuing to 
     *  write additional data; otherwise true.
     */
    let buffer_good = writeStr.write(chunk);
    if (!buffer_good) readerStream.pause();
});
writeStr.on('drain', function () {
    console.log('buffer drained!');
    readerStream.resume();
});
readerStream.on('end', function () {
    //console.log(data);
});

readerStream.on('error', function (err) {
    console.log(err.stack);
});

pipe method is simplest method for implementing back pressure:


const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const inputfileName = path.join(__dirname, 'big.file');
const outputfileName = path.join(__dirname, 'big_copy.file');

const config = {

}

//Back pressure handling
const readerStream = fs.createReadStream(inputfileName, config);

IS it possible to build real time web apps by using just pure http module alone?

 Yes! but it is very complex

How to build real time web applications?

-frameworks and libs.

How to work with frameworks? who provides frameworks ? how frameworks are distributed?

Frameworks and libs are not part of core node js. which is coming from third parties.

as node modules.

node modules types
1.custom module - discussed
2.in built modules - disucssed
3.third party modules - 


Third party modules :
 created by others , we are going to use them.
 like libs,frameworks....

   meta file which describes the project information
2.node_modules folder
   which contains libs/frameworks/tools code.


create package.json file

>npm init

{
  "name": "mynode-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

npm is used

to install,uninstall,publish node modules from node repo / into node repo.

if you install third party modules , into your project, node distributes npm tool ,using this you can install,uninstall,upgrade node modules.


npm syntax:

npm commandName.

node_modules : folder which can hold all javascript modules downloaded from repo.


installing module:

>npm install  moduleName  --options
>npm i moduleName --options


>npm install module 
  here no option is told, means default is --save

>npm i module

options:
 --save ; 
 --save-dev
 -g

App development ; three stage

1.dev
2.testing
3.production.

if you install any packages/dependencies, you can tell that is it for production and developemnt, only devel/testing

if you are installing any node module, you can tell, do you want to use only for development
or development + production.

Unit testing libs : Junit.jar===>java

 --save = >    development + production
 --save-dev => only for development

Which code need not be used for production:

1.All testing related  libs/frameworks - unit,e2s
2.Tools like compilers,frameworks related code.

Who will separate out this depedency(lib) for production/dev

 Build tools -  webpack.
 webpack will scan package.json---extracting prod depedencies

How to unit test javascript applications- serverside/clientside?

-we have frameworks,libs.... ; not necessary for production.


Unit testing Env:

->chai.js

npm install chai --save-dev

"devDependencies": {
    "chai": "^4.2.0"
  }

any thing inside this depdenencies will be used in dev only


npm install chai --save-dev

Automation: scripts;
....................

We can automate js applications.

write all auotomation steps inside scripts

"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }

key: value

key is called command-script command
value is task to be executed. ; task could be any thing.


command can be built in or custom commands

npm provides lot of built in commands

start,test,postinstall,preinstall..........

Node js Web frameworks:

1.express.js


express js is web application framework built on top of core http module.
express abstracts all low level pulmbing web application dev
express can be used to build web api(REST) and dynamic web applications.

Getting started:

>npm i express --save

express contains lot of objects.

1.Application 
2.Request
3.Response
4.Router

express provides a global function

function express(){

}
expression funciton returns application object when you call.

1.Application object

->container object which contains other objects
->Every express applicaiton must have one single application object.

How to create application object?

//require('express') returns a function-factory funciton used to create app
const express = require('express');

//call express variable having funciton to create app object
const app = express();

how to start server?
//start the server
app.listen(3001, () => {
    console.log('Express is ready!!')
})

how to handle req and response?

Core http moudule lacks URL AND METHOD Mapping.

GET    /api/resource
POST   /api/resource
PUT    /api/resource
DELETE /api/resource

Express core idea is to isloate request processing in fine grained way.

//require('express') returns a function-factory funciton used to create app
const express = require('express');

//call express variable having funciton to create app object
const app = express();

//request handling

app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    response.end('Home');
});
app.get('/api/message/hello', (request, response) => {
    response.end('hello');
});
app.get('/api/message/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('hai');
});
app.post('/api/message/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('post');
});
app.put('/api/message/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('put');
});
app.delete('/api/message/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('delete');
});
//start the server
app.listen(3001, () => {
    console.log('Express is ready!!')
})

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Modularizing express application

-based on domain(resource)- message,products,customers.
-folders ; each domain we may have separate folders
-files ; we have to write each resource inside file

//require('express') returns a function-factory funciton used to create app
const express = require('express');
const messageRouter = require('./routers/messagerouter');
const todosRouter = require('./routers/todosrouter');

//call express variable having funciton to create app object
const app = express();

//bind router with main application
app.use('/api/message',messageRouter);
app.use('/api/todos',todosRouter);

//request handling
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    response.end('Home');
});

//start the server
app.listen(3001, () => {
    console.log('Express is ready!!')
})

const express = require('express')
const { findAllNonBlockingPromise } = require('../services/TodoService');
const router = express.Router();


//todos
router.get('/list', async (request, response) => {
    try {
        const todos = await findAllNonBlockingPromise();
        response.status(200).json(todos);
    }
    catch (err) {
        response.status(500).json(err)

    }
});
router.get('/:id', (request, response) => {
    response.end('hai');
});
router.post('/create', (request, response) => {
    response.end('post');
});
router.put('/update', (request, response) => {
    response.end('put');
});
router.delete('/remove', (request, response) => {
    response.end('delete');
});
module.exports = router;

const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/hello', (request, response) => {
    response.end('hello');
});
router.get('/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('hai');
});
router.post('/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('post');
});
router.put('/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('put');
});
router.delete('/hai', (request, response) => {
    response.end('delete');
});

module.exports = router;

npm install moleculer


Core concepts in Molecular:
..........................

Service
 A service is a simple JavaScript module containing some part of a complex application. 
 A service represents a biz logic in your application.

Service Broker : == Spring Container
 Service Broker is the heart of Moleculer.

It is responsible for management and communication between services (local and remote). 
Each node must have an instance of Service Broker.

"Service Broker is one single Node instance - Node runtime"


		         Service1 -- Service 2 Service N
